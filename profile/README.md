<!-- ABOUT US -->
### About Us
<img align="right" height="250" src="https://github.com/eteeXR/.github/blob/1e3abc37248b443f5f4bdba451ea7aadb40db5e9/profile/img/eteeControllers_in_hand.png" alt="eteeController held in hand">

The [eteeControllers][url-eteexr-website] are the first-of-its-kind finger, gesture and pressure sensing controllers 
for VR and non-VR applications.

They offer a better way to play. No need to memorise your button layout. No need to keep hold of a heavy controller 
that makes your hand ache. Just slip etee on, and enjoy smooth control from every finger.

Born in London, it started as a demonstrator for [TG0][url-tg0-website] touch sensing technology and matured over time 
to become a commercial product.
